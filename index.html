        <h2>Although the term "Shih Tzu" means "small lion," this dog breed is not hostile. This dog is more of a lover than a hunter.

   <h2>Dachshunds make excellent family dogs because they are both loyal companions and watchdogs. They are good with children if they are properly cared for. Dachshunds were bred to be hunters, so it's no surprise that many of them enjoy digging. Some are also barkers, and Dachshunds were rated highly for destructiveness in one survey.</h2>
