        <h2>Although the term "Shih Tzu" means "small lion," this dog breed is not hostile. This dog is more of a lover than a hunter. Shih Tzus, which were bred especially to be companions, are amiable, joyful, outgoing house dogs who like nothing more than following their owners from room to room.</h2>
