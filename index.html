        <h2>Although the term "Shih Tzu" means "small lion," this dog breed is not hostile. This dog is more of a lover than a hunter. Shih Tzus, which were bred especially to be companions, are amiable, joyful, outgoing house dogs who like nothing more than following their owners from room to room.</h2>

   <h2>Dachshunds make excellent family dogs because they are both loyal companions and watchdogs. They are good with children if they are properly cared for. Dachshunds were bred to be hunters, so it's no surprise that many of them enjoy digging. Some are also barkers, and Dachshunds were rated highly for destructiveness in one survey.</h2>
 
   <h1>Austrailian Sheperd</h1>

   <h2>The Australian shepherd is an active yet easygoing dog who enjoys romping with children and gets along well with other pets. Australian shepherds make excellent family pets, herding dogs, police dogs, and obedience competitors.</h2>
